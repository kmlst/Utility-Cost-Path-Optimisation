# Utility-Cost-Path-Optimisation
Computing efficiency of deterministic methods of finding the shortest path in a graph, applying them to a knapsack type problem optimizing utility under cost constraint. Finally, as these methods are too slow to be practically implemented, moving on to a probabilistic heuristic with simulated annealing to approach the theoretical solution.
